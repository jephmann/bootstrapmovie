                BootStrapMovies (a working title) is a personal, independent project
                which I began in June 2014 chiefly to stay in practice in between
                jobs. Currently it is a work in progress. I might not include every
                single folder and file in this project, whether complete or not.

                This is a personal demo project wherein I combine Bootstrap
                templates with TheMovieDatabase API. I rarely get opportunities to
                work with pre-existing templates and APIs. Whereas I came across
                these sites on or about the same time, I figured that I might as
                well work with them both at the same time.

            <p>
                I use PHP to convert TheMovieDatabase's incoming JSON into arrays
                which I could sort and otherwise manipulate.

                This is actually my first attempt at a project built almost entirely
                on "found" items -- templates, data, etc. I am accustomed to
                building everything from scratch and my CMS experience is rather
                minimal.
