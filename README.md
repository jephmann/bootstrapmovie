BootStrapMovies (a working title) is a personal, independent project which I
began in June 2014 chiefly to stay in practice in between jobs. Currently it is
a work in progress. I might not include every single folder and file in this
project, whether complete or not.

This is a personal demo project where I attempt combines Bootstrap templates
with TheMovieDatabase API. I rarely get opportunities to work with pre-existing
templates and APIs. Whereas I came across these sites on or about the same time,
I figured that I might as well work with them both at the same time.

Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/

The Movie Database API: http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/

The Movie Database: https://www.themoviedb.org/

In less than 24 hours on this project I already had a movie-title page
cross-reference a person-name page, as I have done a million times before using
my own relational databases.

This is actually my first attempt at a project built almost entirely on "found"
items -- templates, data, etc. I am accustomed to building everything from
scratch and my CMS experience is rather minimal.

Your constructive feedback is welcome and appreciated.
