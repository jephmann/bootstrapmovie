BootStrapMovies (a working title) is a personal, independent project which I
began in June 2014 chiefly to stay in practice in between jobs. Currently it is
a work in progress. I might not include every single folder and file in this
project, whether complete or not.

This is a personal demo project where I attempt combines Bootstrap templates
with TheMovieDatabase API. I rarely get opportunities to work with pre-existing
templates and APIs. Whereas I came across these sites on or about the same time,
I figured that I might as well work with them both at the same time.

Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/

The Movie Database API: http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/

The Movie Database: https://www.themoviedb.org/

In less than 24 hours on this project I already had a movie-title page
cross-reference a person-name page, as I've done a million times before using my
own relational databases.

I would like to add search forms per movie title and person name. Today I ran
into a Sep 02, 2010, tutorial which claimed to do just that. However its demo
gives error messages and it refers to the use of a class stored on GitHub which
the author declared deprecated:

http://www.codeforest.net/simple-movie-search-using-php-jquery-and-themoviedb-org-api

http://www.codeforest.net/demo/movies/search.html

https://github.com/glamorous/TMDb-PHP-API

I suppose that I may have to look elsewhere or invent something myself.

This is actually my first attempt at a project built almost entirely on "found"
items -- templates, data, etc. I am accustomed to building everything from
scratch and my CMS experience is rather minimal.

I do not know whether I will augment this project with other things -- MySQL,
CodeIgniter, MVC, object-oriented programming (I do have a configuration class
which I may omit from GitHub as it has an API key), login security, etc. For now
the priority is to learn and fixate on new (to me) adventures as my job search
continues.
